> **GetElementsResponse**: (`null` \| `object`)[]

The response from the `getElements` method.

## Remarks

The elements in the map, ordered by the order specified in Felt. This is not
necessarily the order that they are drawn in, as Felt draws points above
lines and lines above polygons, for instance.

See [Element](../../client/interfaces/Element.md) for the structure of the element object.
